1) download "project ken" to a local folder
2) open folder with matlab and set project location to "project ken"
3) create empty folder called "tmp_folder" in "project ken"
4) open one of the "main_XXX" scripts. constraint for constraint diagram. dimensional for contour plot. single for single configuration
5) modify line which says "tmp_folder = XXX" to location of folder
6) run first block of code to run iterations. (would recommnend changing XXXlist to reasonable amount of variables for sweep)
7) run second block of code to generate plots
